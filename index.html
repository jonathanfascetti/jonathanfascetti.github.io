            In the spring of 2020, I worked on a project with a peer in a class where we research DNA alignment methods.
            In the begging of the project, we started with learning the basics of the chemistry of DNA, the relevance of
            mutations, and how it affects the production and effectivity of proteins. Most of the work we did was in a
            learning-by-discovery style, where a problem was proposed to us, and we worked together to design a
            solution. We exercised our programming skills and got more familiar with the concepts by doing smaller tasks
            like identifying start codons from DNA and producing an amino acid code chain until an end codon. Later, we
            researched current literature of using computational methods to align DNA sequences to identify protein
            sequences and practiced the methods. One of the biggest challenges we faced in designing and putting these
            methods to use was how to account for mutations when identifying a sequence of DNA (as you want to flag
            sequences that are close enough to a reference one, but the changes are also inevitable). I learned a lot
            both about the chemistry of DNA and mutations as well as advanced computation methods for sequence alignment
            and I particularly enjoyed being able to take what I had learned in computer programming, chemistry classes,
            and biology classes to engineer solutions and problem solve with my peer.

            The sample of code linked below translates a DNA sequeces from a .FASTA file into the corresponding peptide
            sequence. The program finds the length of the peptide, finds stop codon locations, finds double bases and
            their locations, and outputs the found information to a new .FASTA file.

            As part of the course Introduction to Biomedical Engineering in the Fall of 2021, I worked with a small
            group of peers to practice needs finding by discovering a solution gap that exists. Our group explored a
            kidney disease patient's perspective and designed and proposed a solution for a way to perform effective
            interim dialysis during their recovery from invasive preparatory surgeries. We proposed that electric
            stimulation can be directed toward veins which could increase blood flow sufficiently to perform dialysis.
            We used current research to defend our solution as well as principles we learned through the course like
            Poiseuille's law. Throughout the project we had to iterate and engineer various possible solutions to arrive
            at one that we all were happy with. I not only learned a lot about preparatory methods for dialysis but also
            how to work with a group of peers to generate ideas and organize a poster in an effective way.

            In various classes, clubs, and personal interest, I have pursued learn how to use computer aided design
            (CAD) software. The example below is from an engineering class I took senior year of high school and was
            mainly focused around translating measurements into CAD models. Iâ€™ve also gained some experience with CAD
            through a robotics team I was involved with in high school where I helped design parts (e.g., sliding
            clamps) that I made with a 3D printer to go on our autonomous water vehicle. In instances like this, I
            learned a lot about the practicality aspects of using CAD to make objects through means of 3D printing like
            how to deal with inevitable errors. I have also been able to continue to exercise my CAD skills through
            courses in college.

            As part of my senior year final project, I pursued an internship with a Boston University linguistics
            faculty member where we developed a way to visualize her data from user input. In short, we synthesized a
            method to match user input to known data stored in CSV (comma separated value) files and display the output
            data in a web interface. This professor uses this tool we developed together as a data visualization method
            for her research group. While this project allowed me to take away specific skills (like moving data around
            different platforms, datatypes, and programming languages), I also developed strengths that are applicable
            more generally as well. For example, I learned how to view initial ideas from different perspectives in
            order to create a more effective solution, apply and progress my prior programming knowledge to new
            circumstances, and I also had some exposure to fascinating language interpretation methods.

            Starting in my sophomore year of high school (through senior year) I participated in a club at my school
            called BeaverAUV. In the club, we design, program, and build an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to
            compete in an international collegiate competition called RoboSub. When I was part of the club, I mainly
            worked on the computer vison aspects of the AUV. The largest endeavor I took on, in short, was developing a
            way for our AUV to detect gates, which it would have to navigate through independently in the competition.
            Starting as someone who had never done anything related to image processing, I had to do a lot of research
            on which methods would fit our needs, and how to translate them over to the AUV itself. I also had the
            opportunity to collaborate with other team members and learn what they were working on too, like piece
            design with CAD, motor control, and also how to generally manage a club and funding.
            <br><br>
            The image below is an example of what an output from my gate detection program was, which would later be
            implemented to the AUV for live use.
