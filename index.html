            Summer before freshman year of college (2021)
        </h2>
        <p>
            During the summer before starting at Washington University in St. Louis, I worked on a project with a peer I
            graduated high school with and a mentor to create new software in the realm of image processing. We were
            very thorough in how we organized our research, code, and progress. Throughout the summer, I didn’t just
            learn a lot about image processing (e.g., feature detection, homography, and warping), but I also gained
            valuable experience with regard to project management. We practiced Agile development methods (had frequent
            standup meetings and periodic spring review sessions), organized our code in GitHub (frequently committing
            and pulling updates to make sure we did not lose any code between the three of us), and worked together to
            problem solve through issues while considering multiple variables such as run time, usability, etc. To make
            our software usable within an application, more time than a summer is required, so for the time being the
            project is on hold until all our schedules allow us to commit time to it.
            <br><br>
            The image below is an example of how I used homography methods to warp a test image (middle) to the
            perspective of a reference image (left) by means of matched-feature locations (black and white dots on test
            and refrence image) The resultant image is on the right side.

            Spring of junior year of high school, 2020
        </h2>
        In the spring of 2020, I worked on a project with a peer where we researched DNA alignment methods. In the
        begging of the project, we started with learning the basics of the chemistry of DNA, the relevance of mutations,
        and how they affect the production and effectivity of proteins. Most of the work we did was in a
        learning-by-discovery style, where a problem was proposed to us and we worked together to design a solution. We
        exercised our programming skills and got more familiar with the concepts by doing smaller tasks like having a
        script identify start codons from DNA and produce an amino acid code chain until an end codon. Later, we
        researched current literature of using computational methods to align DNA sequences to identify protein
        sequences and put them to practice. One of the biggest challenges we faced in designing and putting these
        methods to use was how to account for mutations when identifying a sequence of DNA (as you want to flag
        sequences that are close enough to a reference one, but the changes are also inevitable). I learned a lot both
        about the chemistry of DNA and mutations as well as gained familiarity with advanced computation methods for
        sequence alignment. Throughout the project, I particularly enjoyed being able to take what I had learned in
        computer programming, chemistry classes, and biology classes to engineer solutions and problem solve with my
        peer.

        The sample of code linked below translates a DNA sequeces from a .FASTA file into the corresponding peptide
        sequence. The program finds the length of the peptide, finds stop codon locations, finds double bases and
        their locations, and outputs the found information to a new .FASTA file.

        <p>
            At the end of my senior year of high school, my school implemented the use of ‘antibacterial’ grips and
            stickers that were placed on door handles and other common-touch places with hopes of mitigating the spread
            of germs during in-person school mid-pandemic. I was curious whether the grips were truly antibacterial, so,
            through an independent study, I put them to the test. Throughout the term, I meticulously crafted a series
            of experiments, performed them, and went through the engineering design process by redesigning my
            procedures. I learned a lot with regard to basic lab skills like mixing and pouring ager plates, swabbing
            methods, and how to execute procedures while maintaining a sterile environment. My experiments were
            unfortunately cut short due to the end of the school year but if I had more time I would have sent out
            bacterial samples I had collected to be sequenced and taxonomically identified so I could do further analyze
            my results and predict what types of bacteria the grips may be effective against. The biggest take away I
            had from the project, though, was how much planning is required to make a well-rounded experiment that
            accounts for many different types of uncertainty.

            As part of the course Introduction to Biomedical Engineering, I worked with a small group of peers to
            practice needs finding by discovering a ‘need’ in a specific population, and design a solution for them. Our
            group explored a kidney disease patient's perspective and designed and proposed a solution for a way to
            perform effective interim dialysis during their recovery from invasive long term preparatory surgeries. We
            proposed that electric stimulation can be directed toward veins which could increase blood flow sufficiently
            to perform dialysis. We used current research to defend our solution as well as mechanical principles we
            learned through the course like Poiseuille's law. Throughout the project we had to iterate and engineer
            various possible solutions to arrive at one that we all were happy with. I not only learned a lot about
            preparatory methods for dialysis but also how to work with a group of peers to generate ideas and organize a
            poster in an effective way.

            In various classes, clubs, and out of personal interest, I have pursued learn how to use computer aided

            was mainly focused around translating physical measurements into CAD models. I’ve also gained some
            experience with CAD through a robotics team I was involved with in high school where I helped design parts
            (e.g., sliding clamps) that I made with a 3D printer to go on our autonomous water vehicle. In instances
            like this, I learned a lot about the practicality aspects of using CAD to make objects through means of 3D
            printing like how to deal with inevitable errors. I have also been able to continue to exercise my CAD
            skills through courses in college.

            As part of my senior year final project, I pursued an internship with a Boston University linguistics
            faculty member where we developed a way to visualize her data from user input. In short, we synthesized a
            method to match user input to known data stored in CSV (comma separated value) files and display the output
            data in a web interface. This professor uses this tool we developed together as a data visualization method
            for her research group. While this project allowed me to take away specific skills (like moving data around
            different platforms, datatypes, and programming languages), I also developed strengths that are applicable
            more generally as well. For example, I learned how to view initial ideas from different perspectives in
            order to create a more effective solution, apply and progress my prior programming knowledge to new
            circumstances, and I also had some exposure to fascinating linguistic interpretation methods.

            Starting in my sophomore year of high school I participated in a club at my school called BeaverAUV. In the
            club, we design, program, and build an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to compete in an international
            collegiate competition called RoboSub. When I was part of the club, I mainly worked on the computer vison
            aspects of the AUV. In short, the largest endeavor I took on was developing a way for our AUV to detect
            gates, which it would have to independently navigate through in the competition. Starting as someone who had
            never done anything related to image processing, I had to do a lot of research on which methods would fit
            our needs, and how to translate them over to the AUV itself. I also had the opportunity to collaborate with
            other team members and learn what they were working on too, like piece design with CAD, motor control, and
            how to generally manage a club and funding.

            As an independent study in the beginning of my senior year of high school, I investigated microbiomes,

            relevant scientific methods and biological systems of microbiomes and their implication onto human health. I
            then synthesized my research and developed a website designed to teach people about the importance of
            microbiomes and the potential impact they have on human medicine. Throughout the project, I really enjoyed
            having the freedom to seemingly endlessly dig deeper and deeper into a field of science, especially since a
            lot of the literature I was reading was very new. I then was faced with taking all of the information I had
