            As part of the course Introduction to Biomedical Engineering in the Fall of 2021, I worked with a small
            group of peers to practice needs finding by discovering a solution gap that exists. Our group explored a
            kidney disease patient's perspective and designed and proposed a solution for a way to perform effective
            interim dialysis during their recovery from invasive preparatory surgeries. We proposed that electric
            stimulation can be directed toward veins which could increase blood flow sufficiently to perform dialysis.
            We used current research to defend our solution as well as principals we learned through the course like
            Poiseuille's law. Throughout the project we had to iterate and engineer various possible solutions to arrive
            at one that we all were happy with. I not only learned a lot about preparatory methods for dialysis but also
            how to work with a group of peers to generate ideas and organize a poster in an effective way.

            In the spring of 2020, I worked on a project with a peer in a class where we research DNA alignment methods.
            In the begging of the project, we started with learning the basics of the chemistry of DNA, the relevance of
            mutations, and how it affects the production and effectivity of proteins. Most of the work we did was in a
            learning-by-discovery style, where a problem was proposed to us, and we worked together to design a
            solution. We exercised our programming skills and got more familiar with the concepts by doing smaller tasks
            like identifying start codons from DNA and producing an amino acid code chain until an end codon. Later, we
            researched current literature of using computational methods to align DNA sequences to identify protein
            sequences and practiced the methods. One of the biggest challenges we faced in designing and putting these
            methods to use was how to account for mutations when identifying a sequence of DNA (as you want to flag
            sequences that are close enough to a reference one, but the changes are also inevitable). I learned a lot
            both about the chemistry of DNA and mutations as well as advanced computation methods for sequence alignment
            and I particularly enjoyed being able to take what I had learned in computer programming, chemistry classes,
            and biology classes to engineer solutions and problem solve with my peer.

            The sample of code linked below translates a DNA sequeces from a .FASTA file into the corresponding peptide
            sequence. The program finds the length of the peptide, finds stop codon locations, finds double bases and
            their locations, and outputs the found information to a new .FASTA file.
